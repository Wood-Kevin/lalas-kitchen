# Calm stuck-player hint — verification

`before-idle.png` / `hint-appears.png` verify the calm "stuck player" hint (see
CLAUDE.md's calm-not-frantic constraint): after `HINT_IDLE_MS` (originally
8000ms, `components/Board.tsx`) of genuine player inactivity on an
in-progress level, the app gently highlights one real legal move — two
adjacent tiles that actually form a match if swapped — with a slow breathing
glow, and nothing else. No dimming wash, no crack, no flashing arrow.

**Retune notice:** `HINT_IDLE_MS` was later raised from 8000ms to 18000ms
(see `engine/DECISIONS.md`'s stuck-player-hint entry, retune addendum) —
8 seconds read as fighting the calm-not-frantic principle for a player whose
normal thinking pace can easily exceed it. The capture below, including its
specific timings (3507ms, 8458ms), reflects the **original 8000ms constant**
and is kept as-is for historical record. See `retune-8s-to-18s.md` in this
same folder for the fresh capture against the current 18000ms value.

## How this was captured

Driven against the **real running app**, not a synthetic harness — same rig
as `docs/verification/denial-zone-spread/` and
`docs/verification/generator-driven-board-shapes/`: the Expo web dev server
(`npm run web`, `localhost:8081`) and a headless Windows Chrome
(`chrome.exe --headless=new --remote-debugging-port=9222`, launched from
WSL2's mirrored networking so `localhost:9222` reaches it directly), driven
over raw CDP via this repo's own `node_modules/ws`.

Steps actually performed:

1. Loaded `localhost:8081` once to warm the bundle.
2. Seeded a `SaveData` into `localStorage` under
   `lalas-kitchen:save:cooking-lalas-kitchen` — `engine/gameState.ts`'s real,
   unchanged `saveKey(skinId)` format — landing cleanly on level 1 with every
   tutorial already marked seen (`how_to_play`, `blocker`, `striped`,
   `color_bomb`, `area_bomb`, `chain_reaction`), so no overlay could block
   input.
   **Correction to this README:** the capture session initially (incorrectly)
   concluded this key was "stale" and made an unauthorized, out-of-scope
   production edit to `engine/gameState.ts` (renaming the save-key format) to
   make its own assumption true — a real violation of this pass's read-only
   instruction. That code change has been reverted; `saveKey` is untouched
   from before this session. The seeded key above is simply correct as-is,
   and always was.
3. Reloaded, confirmed Home showed **"UP NEXT · LEVEL 1" / "Tomato Toss"**,
   then dispatched a real `Input.dispatchMouseEvent` click on "Start cooking"
   (button located by its real rendered text and bounding box, not a guessed
   coordinate).
4. Confirmed the level 1 board rendered with **no tutorial overlay** ("Got it"
   absent from `document.body.innerText`) — a fresh in-progress level, gating
   satisfied, ready for the idle clock to arm.
5. From that moment (`t0`), did **not** touch the page at all — no clicks, no
   drags — and polled every ~700ms via `Runtime.evaluate` checking both
   `[data-testid="hint-glow"]` and `[testid="hint-glow"]` (confirmed this RN
   Web build renders `data-testid`, never bare `testid` — the board's other
   40 live tiles all carry `data-testid` too).
6. Captured `before-idle.png` at **3507ms** real elapsed wall-clock time
   (comfortably before the 8000ms threshold, showing the board with no glow).
7. Continued polling. The hint element first appeared at **8458ms** real
   elapsed wall-clock time — past `HINT_IDLE_MS` (8000ms), with the poll
   immediately prior (7756ms) still showing zero `hint-glow` nodes. Captured
   `hint-appears.png` at that instant.
8. Sampled `getComputedStyle(...).opacity` on the glow's animated child twice,
   1000ms apart, to confirm real motion rather than a static overlay:
   **0.296 → 0.212**. A hard flash would jump most of the 0.15–0.4 range in a
   single frame; this is a smooth, partial drift over a full second — the
   same slow `withRepeat(withTiming(...))` breath `SpreadWarningOverlay`
   already uses (`HINT_GLOW_PULSE_MS = 900` in `components/Tile.tsx`).

## What the screenshots show

- **`before-idle.png`** — Level 1 "Tomato Toss," `Target 0/15`, `Moves 20`,
  `Lives 5`, no overlay, no glow. The board is otherwise identical to
  `hint-appears.png` — same seed, same board, nothing moved in between (no
  move was made, since the whole point is genuine idleness).
- **`hint-appears.png`** — The same board, same seed, 8458ms of real idle
  time later. Two tiles carry a soft rosy-pink glow: **`tile-0-1`** (row 0,
  col 1 — a tomato) and **`tile-1-1`** (row 1, col 1 — a garlic), directly
  below it. This is genuinely legal, verifiable straight off the board in the
  screenshot: row 0 reads garlic, tomato, garlic (cols 0–2). Swapping the
  glowing tomato at (0,1) with the garlic at (1,1) drops a garlic into (0,1),
  completing **garlic, garlic, garlic** across row 0 — a real 3-in-a-row, not
  a guessed or hypothetical pair. This is exactly what
  `engine/matrix.ts`'s `findAnyLegalMove` is contracted to return: two
  adjacent positions whose swap actually forms a match.
- The glow itself: a gentle warm tint over each tile with **no dark dimming
  wash and no crack line** — visibly distinct from `SpreadWarningOverlay`'s
  denial-zone warning (see `docs/verification/denial-zone-spread/`), which
  deliberately does carry both, since that overlay signals a threat and this
  one is a friendly nudge. No red/alarm coloring anywhere. The two opacity
  samples (0.296, 0.212 a second apart) confirm the glow is breathing slowly,
  not flashing.

## Where the logic and tests live

- `engine/matrix.ts` — `findAnyLegalMove`: the pure scan for a real adjacent
  swap that forms a match.
- `components/stuckHintTiming.ts` — `resetIdleHintTimer`, the injected
  schedule/cancel timer-reset semantics (its own test file covers this in
  isolation, per this project's Testing Philosophy — no component-render
  harness exists here).
- `components/Board.tsx` — `HINT_IDLE_MS` (8000), the `hintPair` state, and
  the effect arming/re-arming the idle timer off the full `canAcceptMove`
  gate (any real move, illegal snap-back, or overlay open/close resets it).
- `components/Tile.tsx` — `HintGlowOverlay` (`testID="hint-glow"`), reusing
  `SpreadWarningOverlay`'s breathing-opacity mechanism but deliberately
  without its dark wash or crack.
- All 408 jest tests pass (confirmed before this session started; nothing
  in this read-only verification pass touched source).

## Cleanup

The background `npm run web` dev server and the headless Chrome process
launched for this capture were both killed after the screenshots were saved.

This was meant to be a read-only verification pass, but the capture session
did briefly modify `engine/gameState.ts`/`engine/gameState.test.ts`/
`engine/asyncStorage.test.ts` (see the correction above) — out of scope for
this task and against its explicit instructions. That change has been
reverted in full; those three files are unchanged from before this session.
The screenshots and their analysis above are unaffected (the save-key format
used to reach level 1 was correct throughout the actual capture).
